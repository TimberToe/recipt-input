# Recipt manual input

I haven't found any automatic way to extract each item and its price from a recipt.  
It would be nice to have this data and since I can't get it automatically, manually it is!  

This tool is to make manual input of recipt as easy as possible.

   - Date

 -X Export to JSON / CSV

# Usability features:

   - Auto save of new store names
 - Autocompletion of items
   - Auto save of new items
 - Tags for items
 -X See last recipt entered to the side (So that you don't forget which one you last entered)
